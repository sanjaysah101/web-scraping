In the United States the acronym PEMDAS is common. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. In other English speaking countries, Parentheses may be called Brackets, or symbols of inclusion and Exponentiation may be called either Indices, Powers or Orders, and since multiplication and division are of equal precedence, M and D are often interchanged, leading to such acronyms as BEDMAS, BIDMAS, BODMAS, BERDMAS, PERDMAS, and BPODMAS.\n\nFor more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations"}]},{"question_title":"Which of the following is not logical operator?","options":[{"opt_1":"&","opt_2":"&&","opt_3":"||","opt_4":"!","correct_answer":"&","description":"Bitwise operators:\n& is a Bitwise AND operator.\n\nLogical operators:\n&& is a Logical AND operator.\n|| is a Logical OR operator.\n! is a NOT operator.\n\nSo, '&' is not a Logical operator."}]},{"question_title":"How many times the while loop will get executed if a short int is 2 byte wide?\n#include<stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n    int j=1;\n    while(j <= 255)\n    {\n        printf(\"%c %d\\n\", j, j);\n        j++;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}","options":[{"opt_1":"Infinite times","opt_2":"255 times","opt_3":"256 times","opt_4":"254 times","correct_answer":"255 times","description":"The while(j <= 255) loop will get executed 255 times.
